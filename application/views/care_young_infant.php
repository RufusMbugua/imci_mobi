		<h3>CARE OF YOUNG INFANT (AGED UP TO 2 MONTHS)</h3>
		<section class="text">
			<font class="objectivetext" > In this component of IMCI training you will learn how to care for a young infant aged up to 2 months.
				<br />
				The material in this component is presented in four parts. You will learn how to:
				<br />
				<br />
				<!--style="margin-left:300px" -->
				<ul style="margin-left:300px" >
					<li>
						Ensure essential care for every newborn;
					</li>
					<li>
						Assess and classify every young infant brought for your attention:
					</li>
					<li>
						If needed, identify appropriate treatment, treat the sick young infant and counsel the mother;
					</li>
					<li>
						Ensure correct follow-up.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				For all sick young infants you will use the IMCI case management process described in the IMCI chart entitled ASSESS, CLASSIFY AND TREAT THE SICK YOUNG INFANT.
				<br />
				The processes of managing a young infant aged up to 2 months or a sick child aged 2 months to 5 years are very similar. But young infants have special characteristics that must be considered when classifying their illnesses. For this reason, you will assess, classify and treat the young infant in a somewhat different way from the way you would deal with an older infant or young child.
				<br />
				IMCI does not include the management of conditions related to labour and delivery, or the conditions of a newborn child that require special management, such as asphyxia, sepsis from prematurely ruptured membranes or other intrauterine infection, birth trauma, or conditions due to immaturity. All these conditions are covered in other relevant training courses.
				<br />
				Before using your IMCI case management chart, you should make sure that all newborns receive the appropriate essential care described in the part of this component called Essential care.
				<br />
				Each training unit presents material that will enable you to;
