		<font class="objectivetext"> <strong>Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)</strong> is a strategy for reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with the major causes of childhood illness.
			<br />
			<br />
			IMCI is an integrated approach to child health that focuses on the well-being of the whole child. IMCI aims to reduce death, illness and disability, and to promote improved growth and development among children under five years of age. IMCI includes both preventive and curative elements that are implemented by families and communities, as well as by health facilities.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong><font color="#0000CC">The IMCI strategy focuses on:</font></strong>
			<br />
			<ul style="margin-left:300px">
				<li>
					improving case management skills of health-care providers
				</li>
				<li>
					improving overall health systems
				</li>
				<li>
					improving family and community health practices
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			The IMCI strategy promotes the accurate identification of childhood illnesses, ensures appropriate integrated treatment of all major illnesses, strengthens the counselling of caregivers, and identifies the need of and speeds up the referral of severely ill children. In the home setting, it promotes appropriate care-seeking behaviours, improved nutrition and preventative care, and the correct implementation of prescribed care.
			<br />
			<br />
			The cornerstone of the IMCI strategy is a set of evidence-based clinical guidelines. These guidelines have been designed to provide first-level health workers with simple and effective tools to combat the major causes of childhood mortality and morbidity.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong><font color="#0000CC">RATIONALE FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH</font></strong>
			<br />
			Every year almost 10 million children die before they reach their fifth birthday. A majority of these deaths caused by just five preventable and treatable conditions:
			<br />
			<ol style="margin-left:300px">
				<li>
					pneumonia
				</li>
				<li>
					diarrhoea
				</li>
				<li>
					malaria
				</li>
				<li>
					measles
				</li>
				<li>
					malnutrition
				</li>
			</ol>
			<br />
			Often, those deaths are caused by a combination of the above conditions. Many of childhood deaths could be avoided if those children received appropriate and timely care. In addition, three out of four episodes of childhood illness are caused by these five conditions. </font>
